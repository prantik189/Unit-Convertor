# Unit Converter
This Python program is a simple text-based Unit Converter that allows users to convert values between different measurement units. It runs continuously through a loop, presenting the user with a menu of conversion options until they choose to exit. The program covers conversions for distance (kilometers and miles), temperature (Celsius and Fahrenheit), and weight (kilograms and pounds), making it a handy tool for quick and accurate measurements.

At the start, the program defines six conversion functions. Each function performs a specific mathematical operation to switch between units. For example, km_to_miles(km) multiplies kilometers by 0.621371 to get miles, while miles_to_km(miles) divides miles by the same factor to return kilometers. Similarly, temperature conversions use standard formulas where Celsius is converted to Fahrenheit using (C × 9/5) + 32, and Fahrenheit is reversed to Celsius with (F - 32) × 5/9. Weight conversions follow simple multiplication or division by 2.20462 for converting between kilograms and pounds.

The main program logic runs inside an infinite while loop, displaying a user-friendly menu with numbered options. Based on the user’s input choice, a corresponding conversion function is called. The program takes a numeric input from the user, performs the conversion calculation, and prints the result immediately. If the user enters 7, the program displays a farewell message and stops. Any invalid input triggers a message prompting the user to try again.

Overall, this Unit Converter demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including functions, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling. It emphasizes modular design and arithmetic computation, providing an excellent beginner-level example of how to create an interactive command-line application for everyday utility.
